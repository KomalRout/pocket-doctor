Health-care professionals use symptoms and signs as clues that can help determine the most likely diagnosis when illness is present. Symptoms and signs are also used to compose a listing of the possible diagnoses. This listing is referred to as the differential diagnosis. The differential diagnosis is the basis from which initial tests are ordered to narrow the possible diagnostic options and choose initial treatments.

Self-diagnosis is the process of diagnosing, or identifying, medical conditions in oneself. It may be assisted by medical dictionaries, books, resources on the Internet, past personal experiences, or recognizing symptoms or medical signs of a condition that a family member previously had. For internet searching, it helps to know medical terms for the various signs and symptoms.

Our Symptom Checker for children, men, and women, can be used to handily review a number of possible causes of symptoms that a person, their friends, or family members may be experiencing. There are many causes for any particular symptom, and the causes revealed in the symptom checker are not exhaustive. That is, they are not intended to be a listing of all possible causes for each symptom but are representative of some of the causes that can be underlying various symptoms.

PocketDoctor is a user-friendly, symptom checker android app. The app aims to provide quick and portable access to a self-diagnosing platform.
